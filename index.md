# 👋 Welcome!

Hi! I’m Elizaveta. I’m passionate about hardware and software. I'm interested in all sorts of stuff like PCB designing, programming, and overall, the intersection
between hadrware and software. 

Here are a few of my recent projects:

---

### 💡 [Current Sensing PCB](projects/current-sensing.md)
Current Sensing PCB for my school's (NYU) Robotic Design Team which can detect and display if there is current flowing and a current overload in the robot's motors. 

### 🧠 [Battleship Arcade Game SLDP Project](projects/sldp.md)
Semester Long Design Project from Fall 2024 for which I created the design ideas, circuit schematic, circuit in real life, CAD design, planned the entire workflow, 
and wrote most of the documentation.
