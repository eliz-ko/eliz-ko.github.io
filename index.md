# 👋 Welcome!

Hi! I’m Elizaveta. I’m passionate about hardware and software. I'm interested in PCB designing, programming, 

Here are a few of my recent projects:

---

### 💡 [Current Sensing PCB](projects/current-sensing.html)
Current Sensing PCB for my school's Robotic Design Team which can detect and display if there is current flowing and a current overload in the robot's motors. 

### 🧠 [SLDP Project](projects/ai-classifier.html)
Semester Long Design Project from Fall 2024 for which I created the design ideas, circuit schematic, circuit in real life, CAD design, planned the entire workflow, 
and wrote most of the documentation.
